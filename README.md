## Overview of Election-Audit
In this project, we are helping Colorado Board of Elections employee - Mr. Tom in an election audit. This audit is of the tabulated results for US congressional precinct in Colorado. To automate this audit, we will write a code in a programming language called Python.

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to provide a summary of the election audit. This summary will include total number of votes that were cast in this congressional election, total votes for each candidate and their percentage, and the winner of this election. Furthermore, we will find out which county had the largest number of votes and percentage of votes for each county in the precinct.
